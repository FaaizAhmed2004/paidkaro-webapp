To contribute, things should be followed as:
-- client folder is the frontend
-- rest of things are part of the backend server

Docker will be setup after completion of project for deployment of both frontend and backend

To run Backend FastAPI Server
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

To run Frontend React using npm
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
And there you go.. You can work easily..
